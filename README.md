# edge-darknewtab

**Why edge-darknewtab?**

When I first built this,I had just installed the then newly released Chromium based Edge Browser.

Since then, a lot has changed with the new tab page of Edge having some improvements. 

However, I still find it distracting and think that this new tab page extension may still be useful
to those who love a simple and plain new tab page. 
 
**NOTE**:

1. This extension can work on any Chromium based. The name is just to indicate that the repository was Edge inspired.

2. The search bar currently uses bing as the search engine.
   You can override this by editing the darknewtab.html file. 
   In most cases, this may be unnecessary since you can still use the top address bar which uses your default search engine. 
   Future releases may make this more flexible.


**Installation**

```
git clone git@github.com:Nelson-Gon/edge-darknewtab.git

```
**Enabling the extension**

1. Open Edge(the new Chromium based Edge)

2. Go to Extensions(click the three dots in the top right corner)

3. On the Extensions page, toggle to **enable Developer Mode**.

4. Click **Load Unpacked** and choose the directory that you just cloned(ie edge-darknewtab).

5. Enjoy a distraction free new tab. :)
